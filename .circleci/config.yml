# This build step checks out the code from the repository. It has a hardcoded readonly key to allow the checkout.
# Initially it just fetches the repo metadata for the current commit hash to a depth of 50 commits.
# We need historical commit hashes to calculate diffs between previous and current commits.
# It then checks out the fetched head to actually download the data.
